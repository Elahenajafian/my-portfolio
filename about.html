          Elahe was born and raised in a part of the world called Iran. She
          loved animals ever since she was a young child. She had some animals
          throughout her childhood, like cats, chickens, roosters, ducks, and
          once a turtle. They were her friends. Friends that would always remain
          true to her. She was always concerned about them and did everything
          she could to make sure they were okay. In fact, her dad used to call
          her "The protector of animal rights". She took pride in that title.

          <div>
            In Iran, street animals usually are not welcome into people's lives
            and houses, for good reasons. We are concerned about our health
            issues since the animals spend a lot time in the rubbish looking for
            food. Among street animals, dogs are misunderstood the most. We are
            usually scared of them and have no experience of how friendly and
            loving they could be with humans. Elahe's childhood dream was to
            build an animal shelter;
          </div>
        </div>
        <div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          somewhere that street animals can be hugged and kissed, feel warm, and
          and enjoy a nice meal. She wants to educate children about animals and
          encourage them to approach them with kindness, so that animals and
          humans both can experience the wonderful experience of each other's
          company.
