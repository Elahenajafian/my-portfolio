          Elahe was born in a part of the world called Iran. She loved animals
          since she was a young child. She had some animals through her
          childhood like cats, chickens, roosters, ducks, and a turtle. They
          were like her friends that would always remain true to her. She was
          always concerned about them and did everything she could to make sure
          they were okay. In fact, her dad used to call her "The protector of
          animal rights".

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          Elahe's childhood dream is to build an animal shelter; somewhere that
          street animals can find love, shelter, and food. In Iran, street
          animals are not treated very well in general. Dogs in particular, are
          considered scary and unfriendly. Elahe wants to take care of dogs, and
          famaliarize people with these beautiful animals, and how we have been
          misunderstood about them, and how we don't have to deprive ourselves
          of their wonderful company.
