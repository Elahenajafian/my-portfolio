    <h1>About Elahe</h1>
    <p id="my-description">
      Elahe was born in a part of the world called Iran. She loved animals since
      she was a young child. She had some animals through her childhood like
      cats, chickens, roosters, ducks, and a turtle. They were like her friends
      that would always remain true to her. She was always concerned about them
      and did everything she could to make sure they were okay. In fact, her dad
      used to call her "The protector of animal rights".
      <br />
      Elahe's childhood dream is to build an animal shelter; somewhere that
      street animals can find love, shelter, and food. In Iran, street animals
      are not treated very well in general. Dogs in particular, are considered
      scary and unfriendly. Elahe wants to take care of dogs, and famaliarize
      people with these beautiful animals, and how we have been misunderstood
      about them, and how we don't have to deprive ourselves of their wonderful
      company.
